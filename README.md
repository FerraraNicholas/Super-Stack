# Super-Stack
Done in C#, this program called Super Stack contains a method by the same name that takes a parameter of a string array called operations. Operations contains a string that dictates whether you push, pop or increment. New entries will be pushed on top, a pop will remove the type item while increment will take two integers. The first integer will correspond to how many items will be added to by the second number. This applies to the bottom of the stack.
